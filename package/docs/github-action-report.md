# A PR report that explains what your tests establish

Add `pytest-obligation/report` after the tests that generate your contract evidence.
It updates one comment per PR and report key, writes a job summary, and uploads the
full JSON and Markdown. A failed pytest step still fails the job. Reporting does
not change your validation policy.

The banner and compact headline follow CI-esta's sticky layout. Expand an application
to see its guarantees, missing evidence, failed checks and recovery state.

The header counts applications and passing checks on the left, with failures,
blocked checks, coverage gaps and rejected bindings after a divider. Zero issues
are green. Missing evidence produces an unavailable message instead of green zeroes.
Each application has an aligned compact row with its counts visible while closed.
One to three applications appear directly; larger reports use an outer disclosure.
Applications sort by failed assertions, rejected bindings, blocked execution, then
coverage gaps, with the largest count in the first applicable category first.

GitHub strips custom CSS. The reporter uses fixed-width Shields count images,
monospace application names and native disclosures. The header has no table grid;
elapsed and summed check time share one compact line. Alt text retains the
numbers if images cannot load. The images send only category names and counts to
Shields; application names, reasons and diagnostics remain in GitHub Markdown.

## What the counts measure

Passing, failed, blocked and rejected counts partition unique expected checks.
Related guarantees referencing the same check do not multiply its count. A setup
or cleanup failure is blocked execution; a harness binding rejection takes
precedence over that classification. Expected failures and unexpected passes
remain blocked evidence with their explicit outcome in the details.

Coverage gaps count guarantees, not tests. Each guarantee with a missing
assessment, missing scenario family, no expected checks, declared gap or declined
claim counts once. A failed or filtered check alone does not also add a coverage
gap. Not-applicable declarations are listed separately with application reasons.

Application details include the contract setup assignment when discoverable,
otherwise the suite definition. Links point to the workflow's tested commit,
including the merge commit when that is what checkout tested. Factories and
imported contracts are not traced speculatively to another definition.

New reports record whole pytest-session elapsed time and summed setup/call/cleanup
durations. Per-application durations include retries and parallel work; they are
not elapsed latency and do not measure unrelated tests. Older JSON explicitly
shows missing timing, source and Hypothesis evidence.

The Hypothesis disclosure reports optional generated schedule-exploration cases
and their actual outcomes. Disabled cases appear as disabled and do not inflate
blocked-check counts. Selected exploration cases contribute to the same observed
check counts as other tests. These are scenario-check counts, not example counts;
shrinking statistics and replay histories are not captured here. Failing histories
remain in the pytest log. Hypothesis use inside arbitrary application callbacks
is outside this view. Existing fixed-history proof rules remain unchanged.

## Start with your existing test job

Your project needs pytest-obligation with profile reporting (the current source
includes structured failures; older profile JSON remains readable). Install it in
your normal test environment and bind your application's contract using the
[adoption guide](adopting.md). Installing the reporter alone does not generate
application tests.

```yaml
name: Application contracts
on: pull_request
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
concurrency:
  group: obligation-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
jobs:
  contracts:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v7
      - run: uv sync --locked
      - name: Test application contracts
        id: tests
        run: >-
          uv run --no-sync pytest tests/contracts
          --due-work-profile-report=obligation-profiles.json
      - name: Explain the evidence
        if: always()
        uses: gigaverse-app/pytest-obligation/report@main
        with:
          report-path: obligation-profiles.json
          sticky-key: application-contracts
          test-outcome: ${{ steps.tests.outcome }}
```

Use your existing test command, services and test path. The reporter installs its
own isolated Python runtime from the action revision; it does not import your
application or alter its environment. Pin the action to a reviewed commit for
production. The action is available on `main`. A release pin must contain `report/action.yml`;
older releases without that path cannot provide this action.

Use a stable, distinct `sticky-key` for each test session or matrix lane. This
version reads one complete session report per key. It does not combine reports
from unrelated sessions or certify absent contracts. Workflow concurrency should
serialize writers for the same PR/key. The publisher also checks the current PR
head and refuses older run IDs/attempts; GitHub comments have no atomic update API.

Fork PRs receive a summary and artifact without a comment. `post-comment: 'false'`
also disables publication; remove the write permission in that case. Missing
comment permission preserves the summary/artifact. A missing, empty or invalid
JSON file produces **Evidence unavailable**, never a green verdict. Do not run
untrusted PR code with a write token under `pull_request_target` to bypass this.

Pass `test-outcome` so a collection error or a failure outside the generated
contracts remains visible even when the recorded contract checks passed. Without
it, overall test-step status is explicitly **unknown**.

## Which words belong to whom?

| Report content | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Application name, suite path, scenario name, reason for a gap | Your contract/test code; explicitly labeled **application** |
| Receipt status, attempt, retry time and other diagnostic fields | Your `RecoveryExample.diagnose` callback; labeled **State (application)** |
| Guarantee names, result labels, phase, fault count, owed/progress observations | pytest-obligation's evidence model |
| Generated case IDs | Library profile/check IDs, sometimes including application-supplied scenario names |

For example, `pending` is an application receipt state. It is not a failing pytest
result. The failure is the assertion that recovery should have completed while the
observed item is still owed. The report keeps those concepts in separate columns.

## More tests, better tests, or a real failure?

| Result | What it establishes | What you should do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Supported by this run** | Every check and assessed scenario required by this declared claim passed | Keep adding meaningful application-specific risks as you discover them |
| **Coverage not assessed** | A guarantee or scenario family has no assessment | Bind production code and add scenarios, or state why it is outside scope |
| **Test not collected / filtered out / skipped or incomplete** | Existing expected checks did not finish successfully in this session | Run those checks; writing more tests alone does not fix this |
| **Known gap declared** | Your application explicitly describes a limitation | Read its reason: it may require implementation changes, bindings, or both |
| **Test binding rejected** | A harness guard rejected this test's connection to production behavior | Fix that binding. The affected check provides no supporting evidence |
| **Check failed** | An executed assertion failed | Inspect behavior and the contract's assumptions; do not assume every assertion failure is an application bug |
| **Test setup/cleanup failed** | The fixture/environment failed before or after the behavioral assertion | Repair it and rerun; successful call output alone is insufficient |
| **Not claimed / not applicable** | Your application deliberately excludes a guarantee | Review the reason; a passing declaration check does not prove the excluded guarantee |

The report cannot generally decide that a passing test is meaningless. It flags
binding rejections from actual harness guards, such as test-authored callbacks
that reference no production code. Those guards are targeted checks, not a proof
that all other tests are good. Unknown failure types remain **Check failed**.
The displayed advice is derived from recorded states, not an AI diagnosis.

## Failure details and data exposure

The plugin adds phase, failure category, a bounded exception message and structured
recovery notes to profile JSON. These fields survive distributed report merging.
Old JSON without the new optional fields still renders, with less detail. Tools
using the older strict JSON model must be upgraded to read the new fields.

On recovery failures, the comment shows fault counts, still-owed/progress
observations and application diagnostic state. Only provide safe metadata in
`diagnose`: never customer content, tokens, or credentials. Exception messages and
contract reasons also enter the artifact/comment. The renderer escapes HTML,
Markdown and mentions; escaping is not secret redaction. Review your report before
publishing it to a public repository. Large comments explicitly omit details and
point to the retained JSON artifact.

## Render locally

```bash
python -m pytest_obligation.reporting \
  --input obligation-profiles.json --output obligation-report.md
```

This reads JSON as data and recomputes verdicts from evidence. Stored `verified`
and `passed` display values cannot turn missing/failed execution into green.
The terminal's `--due-work-summary` remains available alongside the PR report.
